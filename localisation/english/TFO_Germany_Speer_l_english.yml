###IDEAS
 GER_TFO_Fuhrer_dream:0 "The Führer's Dream"
 GER_TFO_Fuhrer_dream_desc:0 "Our great Führer Albert Speer has brought about where there was once a crippled nation with an economy on the edge of total collapse, hated by the rest of the world, and nearly destroyed in the German Civil War of 1963-1964. A clean, efficient and effective industrial state dominated by him and those loyal to his cause, a nation that can draw upon resources from not just its allies and puppets in the Zollverein but now, the whole world. As the founder of the KDN and architect of Germany's diplomatic rebranding our great Führer has once more given us access to markets across the earth, flooding stores with products and resources  labeled "Made In Germany". Now with our economy ever growing thanks to nearly two decades of reform our future seems secure, at least for the time being."
 GER_TFO_new_wehrmacht:0 "The New Wehrmacht"
 GER_TFO_new_wehrmacht_desc:0 "For over 4 decades the Wehrmacht have proudly defended the Reich against all her enemies, whether it was on the fields of France or plains of Eastern Europe, Germany's fighting men have long stood by there Führer. However following the Slave Revolt it became evident to Speer that something was wrong, the Army had become complacent since the civil war and increasingly weak, furthermore they had been infiltrated by men who had seemingly forgotten there loyality.\n\nAs such Von Tresckow found himself removed and replaced by a man much more suited to the Führer's needs. His replacement General Otto Ernst Remer who had proved his loyalty to the Führer through the revolt of Ferdinand Schörner instantly embarked upon a campaign of mass restructuring, purging all those disloyal to the Reich and implementing a new campaign of modernization and discipline. However in recent years the Wehrmacht has once more become divided with Remer's militarists finding themselves in conflict with the reformists and remaining old guard of the Reich."
 GER_TFO_stain_of_our_past:0 "The Stain of our Past"
 GER_TFO_stain_of_our_past_desc:0 "The Gang Of Four, The Leftists, Reichsbanner, The Ungrateful students and degenerates of the Reich, all have been crushed by the Führer for there treachery and treason shown during the Slave Revolt, The Recession Of 73, and the Moskewein revolt. These groups, masterminded by the traitor named Schmidt, attempted to overthrow our regime and install a weak, foreign influenced Liberal government. But their plans were halted thanks in no small part to Remer and his militarists working alongside the Führer to crush their Marxist plot and restore order to land keep the Führer in his rightful place.\n\nOur Government, despite having been freed from their influence, still remains stained by their treachery with students and politicians across the Reich still secretly loyal to their cause and working to internally disrupt our government and overthrow our great nation in order to turn it over the Bolsheviks and Americans."
