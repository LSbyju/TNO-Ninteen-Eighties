 REGIONAL_INFO_ANTARCTICA:0 "§G==ANTARCTICA==§!\n\n§WAntarctica§! is a cold and unforgiving place. Until the §Y1950s§!, the world's southernmost continent was largely ignored, only visited by the occasional §Gscientific research team§! or the one-off §Gmilitary expedition§!. The land was divided and claimed by the various powers of the world, but those claims carried little diplomatic weight, as nations preferred to focus on the more inhabitable regions of the world. This would all change in the early §Y50s§!, with the §iScramble for Antarctica§!.\n\nIt started with a diplomatic dispute between §RChile§! and §aArgentina§!, over a bunch of tiny islands that had formerly been claimed by the British, before their defeat in the Second World War. Both nations, technically, had valid claims to the islands. §aArgentina§!, in order to secure their sovereignty over the region they had claimed, began the process to formalize their §WAntarctica Territory§!, as well as adopt some of that land that had previously been claimed by the British, and was now left unadministered. §RChile§! contested this action, prompting the §QUnited States of America§! to get involved in their negotiations to help mediate their dispute, as well as stake their own claims to the Antarctic region. Things developed quickly from there.\n\n§eThe Empire of Japan§!, eager to further tighten their grip over the Pacific, claimed the area formerly known as Marie Byrd Land, dispatching a small military force in order to secure the territory before the §QAmericans§! could try anything. The §QUnited States of America§! was quick to respond in kind, consolidating the Australian, New Zealand, and former French claims into the §QOFN Antarctic Administration§!. The §rGerman Reich§! usurped the claim of the now-Reichskommissariat Norway, which already overlapped with their Antarctic claim, combining the two into the territory now known as §rNeuschwabenland§!. In the hastily finished negotiations between the two South American countries, §RChile§! got the short end of the stick, getting relatively little of their claimed region, while §aArgentina§! secured sovereignty over the Trinity Peninsula and many of the surrounding islands. In the span of a week, the §iScramble for Antarctica§! had carved the continent into five territories, as the Cold War grew ever §Wcolder§!.\n\nBy §Y1962§!, §WAntarctica§! has only become more exploited and militarized. The §QOFN Antarctic Administration§! is an important training ground and staging base for clandestine actions in the Indian Ocean, with the §eJapanese Antarctic Sector§! doing much of the same to their East. Both sides keep a close eye on the border. Following some failed colonization attempts in the §Y1950s§!, §rNeuschwabenland§! has become a testing site for experimental aircraft, cold weather equipment, and, according to unconfirmed reports, nuclear technology. Silently, the §IAhnenerbe§! operate a base out of western §rNeuschwabenland§!, conducting their own §Ishadowy operations§! away from prying eyes. §aArgentina§!, content with her claims, uses the region for scientific purposes, often allowing foreign scientists to visit the region. §RChile§! has adopted similar policies, although their administration would enjoy being given a bit more of the swath of territory that they claimed.\n\nEven with modern technology, Antarctic is still a dangerous place, ripe with unforgiving weather, deadly crevasses, and poor infrastructure. Try as they may to dominate §WAntarctica§!, the frozen continent has never been kind to strangers."

 esoteric_nazism_antarctic_administration_subtype_desc:0 "Translated as "Ancestral Heritage", the organization known as the Ahnenerbe has been tasked since 1935 with finding archaeological evidence for the biological primacy of the Aryan race. Formed by the order of the Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler, this eclectic group of archaeologists, theoreticians, and Nazi ideologues have spent the last three decades scouring the globe and its cultures for concrete proof of Aryan Racial Theory. From the Reichskommissariats of the Lebensraum to the jungles of Latin America, agents of the Ahnenerbe have excavated, bought, or stolen artifacts of every kind, with a particular focus on human remains.\n\nTheir mandate means they are literally willing to go to the ends of the Earth in search of their proof. Projects as wide ranging as they are bizarre, such as the Hollow Earth Theory or the Quest for the Irminsul, have dominated the minds of the Ahnenerbe leadership. Reichsgeschäftsführer Wolfram Sievers, under the explicit orders of Himmler, has been dispatched to Antarctica to find proof of World Ice Theory, that is, proof that the world and all its contents stem from a glacial formation that surrounds our observable universe. Scientists everywhere have derided the insane theories and criminal work of the Ahnenerbe, much of which is blatant fabrication and outright lies. To the National Socialist cause, however, these theories form the bedrock of their denial of reality. Under normal conditions, this group is an eccentric, extreme lot. God only knows what the pressures of Antarctica will do to their psyches."

It was for this purpose that Esperanza Base was built. It came to be the foundation of Argentine power projection in the region and ensured their influence extended far enough to establish firm sovereignty over their Antarctic claim.\n\nEsperanza is now one of the most multifaceted bases on the continent. It serves as a naval port, a military outpost, and an administrative complex for Argentinean Antarctica and Argentina itself. The military aspect of Esperanza is particularly accentuated today, as the Argentine military uses the base to expand its power and seek its own ends..."

McMurdo Station is the largest base on the Antarctic continent, populated by up 1,500 people in the height of summer, boasts a sizable port, and is serviced by nearby Williams Field for aerial transportation.\n\nThis behemoth of the Antarctic Wastes sits in the Ross Dependency of Antarctica, a region inside New Zealand's claim, but is administered by the USA's Antarctic Development Command. It was built on the volcanic Ross Island during the first Operation Deep Freeze, which took place in the midst of the Scramble.\n\nOf its many quirks, the most unique is its nuclear power station, created to solve fuel issues at the base. While it provides a substantial amount of power and reduces the need for fuel, it remains an unknown in the emerging field of nuclear power, one that could have devastating consequences."

 state_lore_desc.999:0 "The German Empire stretches across much of the world, and at its very edge Schirmacher Station stands defiant against the desolation of Antarctica. The base is built in an Antarctic oasis that was discovered and named by Richardheinrich Schirmacher during the 3rd German Antarctic Expedition. These oases are patches of land naturally free of snow and ice, which, along with the oasis' easy access to freshwater lakes and vast 25 km long and 3 km wide size, made it an advantageous location for settlement during the Scramble for Antarctica.\n\nSchirmacher Station was initially created as the military counterpart to the colonial effort started by Germany on the frigid continent. However, the plan for long-term and expansive settlement proved to be out of human reach, and Schirmacher now looms over the abandoned colonial site.\n\nThe station houses about 500 people maximum. This creates the need for the interdependence Schirmacher Station shares with its neighboring bases, which house around the same number of people but rely on Schirmacher's greater stores of rations and supplies to sustain themselves. Along with this relationship, Schirmacher also lacks a seaport and airfield. Instead it uses the nearby Admiral Graf Spee Harbor and an experimental aircraft testing base."

More comparable to a military base than a traditional Antarctic base, Shōwa projects its power over the entirety of Nobu Shirase Land, formerly Marie Byrd Land, and remains uncontested in the area.\n\nHowever, due to the ice that surrounds the base, it is only accessible by helicopter, plane, or icebreaker, leaving it essentially cut off from the IJN and their potential supply."

Its name: Begerheim. Named after the intrepid Aryan explorer, Bruno Beger, this Ahnenerbe stronghold was tasked with finding evidence to support a number of fundamental scientific theories.\n\nThe population of Begerheim is small compared to other Antarctic claims: two-hundred and fifty souls, split between Ahnenerbe scientists and a detachment of Waffen-SS security personnel. It operates a heliport for archaeological sorties and a hidden submarine bay through which Burgundy and the Reichsführer-SS himself maintain contact with the base and ensure crucial supply deliveries.\n\nBegerheim is nominally a part of the German claim of Neuschwabenland, however contact between the two organizations is sparse and often unfriendly, especially in the wake of the attempted SS coup in the Fatherland. How long this uneasy coexistence will last is anyone's guess. The Ahnenerbe conduct themselves with extreme secrecy. Information about the internal goings-on of Begerheim rarely leaves the stronghold's walls. When it does, the world trembles."
